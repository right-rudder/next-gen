If you want a personable, responsive school that will train you right, address any questions and get you there, you've come to the right place. I've had great experiences with all of the staff and instructors, they always raise the bar and amaze me. The instructors will always level with you, and encourage you, and it's a rare talent to do both consistently. And remember: Anyone named Amanda has got your back. :)",

The flight lasted a little over an hour round trip. And our instructor let us know that we were flying 120 mph on our way back. It was an overall really great experience. I'm definitely doing another 'intro flight' to Catalina Island next time!!!",
