It is typically used for both primary and advanced training, benefiting from reliable avionics and efficient fuel consumption. The 172H is equipped with a Continental O-300 engine, providing a balance of power and fuel efficiency. This model maintains the high-wing design and durable construction characteristic of the 172 series.",
