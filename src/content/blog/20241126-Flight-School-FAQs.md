Are you considering becoming a pilot and looking for answers about flight school? At NextGen Flight Academy, we provide professional pilot training at our Riverside and Redlands locations. Below are common questions about flight schools, including what to expect, how to get started, and why NextGen is the right choice for your training.

## What Does a Flight School Offer?

Flight schools teach you how to fly airplanes and prepare you for various pilot certifications. At NextGen Flight Academy, we offer training for:

- **Private Pilot License (PPL)**
- **Instrument Rating (IR)**
- **Commercial Pilot License (CPL)**
- **Multi-Engine Rating (ME)**
- **Certified Flight Instructor (CFI, CFII, MEI)**
- **Airline Transport Pilot License (ATP)**

Our FAA-approved programs follow the Gleim syllabus and are available under both Part 61 and Part 141 regulations.

## How Long Does It Take to Become a Pilot?

The time required depends on your availability and goals. On average, earning a Private Pilot License can take 3–6 months if you train consistently. At NextGen Flight Academy, we offer flexible scheduling and accelerated programs like our “Zero to Hero” option, which can prepare you for a career in aviation faster.

With 320 flying days a year in Riverside and Redlands, you’ll have more opportunities to complete your training efficiently.

## What Are the Requirements to Start Flight Training?

To start training at NextGen Flight Academy, you must:

1. Be at least 16 years old (to fly solo) or 17 (for a Private Pilot License).
2. Speak, read, and write English proficiently.
3. Hold a valid FAA medical certificate.

We welcome students from all backgrounds, including international students. Financing options are also available through Stratus and Pilot Finance.

## How Much Does Flight Training Cost?

Costs vary based on the program and the aircraft used. At NextGen Flight Academy, our rates are competitive, and we offer block discounts. For example:

- **Cessna 172**: $154.99/hour (normal rate), $149.99/hour (block rate)
- **Piper Warrior**: $179.99/hour (normal rate), $174.99/hour (block rate)
- **Redbird Simulator**: $74.99/hour (normal rate), $69.99/hour (block rate)

## What Is the Difference Between Part 61 and Part 141 Training?

Both are FAA-approved paths to becoming a pilot. Part 61 offers flexibility, allowing you to set your own pace. Part 141 is more structured and suited for career-track students. At NextGen Flight Academy, we provide both options to fit your needs.
