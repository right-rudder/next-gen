Your first solo flight is a defining moment in your training. After weeks of preparation and practice with your instructor, you’ll take off, fly a pattern, and land—all by yourself.

## How You Get There

- **Pre-solo training:** Takeoffs, landings, emergency procedures, and radio communication
- **Endorsement:** Your instructor signs you off after ensuring you’re ready
- **Conditions:** Solo flights typically happen in good weather and familiar airspace

## What the Flight Looks Like

- Taxi, takeoff, and climb out on your own
- Fly the airport traffic pattern
- Make a smooth landing
- Taxi back and celebrate your first milestone as a pilot

## Emotional Milestone

Many pilots say this is the moment they truly feel like aviators. It’s the first time you fully trust your training and skills.

## Why Southern California Helps

With stable weather and predictable conditions, students at Riverside and Redlands can reach their solo flight faster and with more consistency.

## Get Started

Your solo flight begins with a discovery flight and structured training.
