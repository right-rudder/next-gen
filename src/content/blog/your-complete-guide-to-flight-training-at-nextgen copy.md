A discovery flight is your first, hands-on lesson with a certified instructor. Youâ€™ll get a safety briefing, learn the basics of controls, and take the controls in the airâ€”typically in a Cessna 172â€”before your instructor lands the airplane. At NextGen Flight Academy (Riverside KRAL & Redlands KREI), you can book an intro flight and be in the left seat the same day.

## What happens on a discovery flight?

- Meet & brief (10â€“15 min). Your instructor covers aircraft basics, safety, and the plan for the flight.
- Preflight walk-around. See how pilots inspect flight controls, fuel, and instruments.
- Taxi & takeoff. Your instructor handles the busy bits; youâ€™ll follow along on the controls.
- You fly. In cruise, youâ€™ll try gentle turns, climb/descend, and keep heading and altitude.
- Return & debrief. Review what you did and how flight training works at Riverside (KRAL) or Redlands (KREI).

**Good to know:** An intro flight counts as official loggable training time with an FAA-certified instructor.

## Why do it with NextGen Flight Academy?

- **Two convenient airports: Riverside Municipal (KRAL) & Redlands Municipal (KREI)â€”great airspace for new pilots and year-round flying.

- **Modern training tools:** Access to a Redbird simulator for procedures and instrument practice to reinforce what you learn in the air.

- **Clear training path:** From Private Pilot through advanced ratings, all under experienced instructors in Southern California.

## What should I bring?

- Government-issued photo ID (passport or driverâ€™s license).
- Comfortable clothes & closed-toe shoes.
- Sunglasses and water.
- Questions! Ask about training time, budget, and how your schedule fits our programs.

## Can I pick my route?

_Often, yes._ Riverside flights frequently tour local landmarks like Lake Mathews and the surrounding foothills; special routes (like a Disney corridor experience) are also available as themed intro flights. Ask when you book.

## How much does it cost and how long is it?

- **Time:** Commonly ~30 minutes in the air (plus briefing and taxi time).

- **Price:** Check our current intro-flight pricing and specials on the booking page; offers vary by location or theme.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Do I need prior experience?**
  _No. Your instructor will teach you everything you need for a safe, fun first lesson._

- **What if I get nervous?**
  _Totally normal. We start with gentle maneuvers, and your instructor is on the controls with you at all times._

- **Is there an age limit?**
  _Intro flights welcome teens and adults; ask us about recommended ages and parent/guardian consent for minors._

- **Will this count toward my license?**
  _Yesâ€”time with an FAA-certified instructor is loggable and applies to future training._

- **What aircraft do you use?**
  _Most discovery flights use a Cessna 172 (stable, four-seat trainer). Fleet options vary by day and location._
