If you want a personable, responsive school that will train you right, address any questions and get you there, you've come to the right place. I've had great experiences with all of the staff and instructors, they always raise the bar and amaze me. The instructors will always level with you, and encourage you, and it's a rare talent to do both consistently. And remember: Anyone named Amanda has got your back. :)",

I'm definitely doing another 'intro flight' to Catalina Island next time!!!",
